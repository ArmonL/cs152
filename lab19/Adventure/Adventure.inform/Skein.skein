Uncle Carl is a nice man.  Sometimes he has a treat.

Dining Room
The humans are all in the next room.  You smell some tasty food from on top of the table. 

It is a wide chair.  Uncle Carl usually sits there

SJSU
You arrive at school, dodging potholes, debris, and terrible drivers on the road. The sun&apos;s already up and people are out and about. You lock your bike in the bike cage and quickly head to MacQuarrie Hall. This is SJSU, a college in Silicon Valley with a long history, stuck in the middle of downtown San Jose. You should go to the CS Club and get some work done before class starts.

The staircase leads up to the clubroom on the second floor.

You feel unprepared.

This is the CS club room. CS stuff happens here. Strange, where is everyone?

The staircase leads to the first floor and the rest of SJSU.

You feel unprepared.

Alright, let&apos;s get cracking! You open up your laptop and get started, going through the boot sequence and typing in passwords.
You plug in your laptop to charge it up. But what&apos;s this? The clubroom&apos;s door slams shut, and metal shielding covers the windows. The room goes dark, sirens blare, and red lights flash. It&apos;s the Cyber Room!

Cyber Room
The room is dark, there&apos;s flashing lights, and fast tempo electronica. Is this Def Con? A sign above the door says &quot;Cyber Room&quot;. Evidently, the cyber happens here. A big red button appears beside you.

You can see Button here.

SJSU
You arrive at school, dodging potholes, debris, and terrible drivers on the road. The sun&apos;s already up and people are out and about. You lock your bike in the bike cage and quickly head to MacQuarrie Hall. This is SJSU, a college in Silicon Valley with a long history, stuck in the middle of downtown San Jose. You should go to the CS Club and get some work done before class starts.

The staircase leads up to the clubroom on the second floor.

You feel unprepared.

You should go to the CS Club and get some work done before class starts.

You arrive at school, dodging potholes, debris, and terrible drivers on the road. The sun&apos;s already up and people are out and about. You lock your bike in the bike cage and quickly head to MacQuarrie Hall. This is SJSU, a college in Silicon Valley with a long history, stuck in the middle of downtown San Jose. You should go to the CS Club and get some work done before class starts.

Alright, let&apos;s get cracking! You open up your laptop and get started, going through the boot sequence and typing in passwords.
You plug in your laptop to charge it up. But what&apos;s this? The clubroom&apos;s door slams shut, and metal shielding covers the windows. The room goes dark, sirens blare, and red lights flash. You&apos;re in the cyber Room!

The room is dark, there&apos;s flashing lights, and electronic music is playing. Is this Def Con? A sign above the door says &quot;Cyber Room&quot;. Evidently, the cyber happens here.

The room is dark, there&apos;s flashing lights, and electronic music is playing. Is this Def Con? A sign above the door says &quot;Cyber Room&quot;. Evidently, the Cyber™ happens here.

Robot Fox yaps mechanically.

You can also see a laptop and Security Button here.

SJSU
You arrive at school, dodging potholes, debris, and terrible drivers on the road. The sun&apos;s already up and people are out and about. You lock your bike in the bike cage and quickly head to MacQuarrie Hall. This is SJSU, a college in Silicon Valley with a long history, stuck in the middle of downtown San Jose. You should go to the CS Club and get some work done before class starts.

The staircase leads up to the clubroom on the second floor.

You feel unprepared.

Clubroom
This is the CS club room. CS stuff happens here. You should take out your laptop and get working. Strange, where is everyone?

The staircase leads to the first floor and the rest of SJSU.



    *** A sinking feeling washes over you. Where&apos;s your laptop?! Unfortunately you can&apos;t get anything done today. ***



Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?
